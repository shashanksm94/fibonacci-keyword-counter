The zip file contains the following – 
* makefile 
* ‘Keyword_Counter’ project directory
* Keyword_Counter/src/Node.java
* Keyword_Counter/src/FiboHeap.java \
* Keyword_Counter/src/KeywordCounter.java 
* Report.pdf 
* The 3 source files again (for makefile)	-> Node.java, FiboHeap.java, and KeywordCounter.java \
\

The makefile command can be directly run in the main directory as the source files are present in it. \
It can be used in two ways as follows: \
* Compile using makefile and run in standard way-

* Compile and run using makefile-
> make  run  FILE={absolute_file_path}
